## Keyboard

My keyboard is a [corne-style split keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) and I'm using the [zmk](https://zmk.dev/) firmware, made by: [@tupinikeebs](https://www.instagram.com/tupinikeebs/).

## Dependencies

- [zmk-nice-oled](https://github.com/mctechnology17/zmk-nice-oled): A library for controlling the OLED display.
- [keymap-drawer](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer): I've added this workflow visualize the keymap as an image.
